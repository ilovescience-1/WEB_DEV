        <center><h2> different types positions</h2></center>
        <center><p>There are different types of potions such as libro, setter, outside hitter, and opposite hitter, there is also a middle blocker.</p></center>
        <center><p>The libro picks up all the balls that are harder to pick up and the libro might even have to dive for it this is the position i do. Ive been doing volleyball for 4 years and ive come to realize its one of my top 3 favorite sports. </p></center>
